This repo is designed for learning about and implementing adaptive signal processing. The end goal will be to implement a set of classes designed to implement adaptive signal processing for a variety of applications. One main aspect of the field I will be looking into is Space-Time Adaptive Processing. Note, that while the final class implementations will be in c++, the learning scripts and tests will be in MATLAB for convience. 

Note: there will also be some simulations containing work concerning optimal filtering, as the theroy behind these filters is largely important for the understanding of Adaptive filtering!
